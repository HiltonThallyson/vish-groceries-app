# Vish - groceries shopping app

This project was developed during the mobile development disciplina at UFRN in 2022. It consists in a shopping app for groceries. The idea was to build an app that allows users to make their grocery shopping easier and automatic (if wanted).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to execute the app:
  - git clone [https//github.com/HiltonThallyson/vish-groceries-app.git](https://github.com/HiltonThallyson/vish-groceries-app.git) to copy this repository locally
  - create a firebase project and configure an app there
  - follow the firebase instructions to add firestore database to your project
  - follow the firebase instructions to add authentication to your project
  - in your terminal, inside the project folder, run flutter pub get to get all the flutter dependencies
